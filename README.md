# Component Library

This repo contains a simple sandbox based off of create-react-app, but with a bunch of linting tools and styled-components added. The list of add-ons and customizations will expand, but I'm going to try and keep from ejecting CRA. The new Babel macros help with that, and I'm going to see how far I can push them.

## Usage

```cmd
yarn start
```

```cmd
yarn test
```
